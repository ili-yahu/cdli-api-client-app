# Presentation
A simple (planned) multi-OS application that aims to streamline the user experience for the CDLI API by providing a GUI and suggestions for input commands.

# Install
## Warning
This application has only been tested on a Windows 11 computer. I still need to try to package the app for Linux and MacOS. For now, you will have to package it yourself by installing Node.js and the dependencies (mostly by typing `npm install XXXX` in the Node.js command prompt) mentioned in the package.json file until I'm able to do it on a Mac.

A great share of the code has been written with the help of the LLM ChatGPT-4 mini. This means that the code still needs a whole lot of cleaning up to improve it and I have yet to do it. In the mean time, feel free to submit improvements, fork the repository, etc...

## Prerequisites
If you plan to use the packaged version of the program, you should normally be able to install the .exe and run the application without having to install anything first.

For MacOS and Linux users, or for the people who don't want to use a packaged application, as mentioned above, you will have to install Node.js and launch the code from there. The GUI will still work fine.
